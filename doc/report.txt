🚀 Execution Command

batch sie is 4, but how big was each batch?

Optimizing tool selection...

When you set --batch_size 4, the "size" of each batch is measured in two ways: by the number of chunks and by the total character count.

Based on your current run and the defaults in paper_to_audio.py:154-157:

1. The Chunk Count (Fixed at 4)
The script attempts to group 4 semantic chunks into a single GPU forward pass.

Each chunk is created by split_text, which tries to keep segments under 800 characters (usually splitting at paragraph or sentence boundaries).
2. The Character Volume (Variable)
Because chunks are split semantically (to avoid robotic mid-sentence cuts), they aren't all the same length.

Average Batch Size: Typically between 2,400 and 3,200 characters.
Maximum Safety Limit: The script has a max_batch_chars safety limit of 6,000 characters.
How clamp_batch_size works:
Before sending a batch to the GPU, the paper_to_audio.py:318 function checks the total length of the next 4 chunks.

If Sum < 6,000: It processes all 4 chunks at once.
If Sum > 6,000: It automatically reduces the batch size (e.g., to 3 or 2) for that specific step to prevent your GPU from running out of memory (OOM).
For your paper (approx. 133,000 characters), the script processed 229 chunks in roughly 58 batches (229 / 4). Each batch took about 110-140 seconds to generate on your hardware.
